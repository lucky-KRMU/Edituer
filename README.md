# 🖼️ Image Editing Software (Python + Tkinter + OpenCV)

A beginner-friendly desktop image editing application built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **OpenCV**.  
This project focuses on understanding **GUI development**, **image processing concepts**, and **software structure**, rather than just producing results.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to deeply understand:
- How desktop applications work internally
- How Tkinter handles GUI components and events
- How OpenCV processes and manipulates images
- How to design a clean, modular Python application

This project is **learning-oriented**, not exam-oriented.
